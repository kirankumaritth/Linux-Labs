#### Step 4: Allocate Memory (RAM)

#### Step 8: Start the Virtual Machine

- Click "Start" to launch the virtual machine.
- The virtual machine will boot from the Ubuntu ISO.

#### Step 9: Install Ubuntu

- Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu.
- Choose your language and click "Install Ubuntu."
- Follow the installation wizard, including selecting your time zone, keyboard layout, and creating a user account.
- When prompted, choose the option to erase the disk and install Ubuntu (or manually partition if you have specific requirements).

- After the installation is complete, eject the installation ISO.
- Restart the virtual machine.

#### Step 11: Post-Installation Steps

- Complete the initial setup, including updating the system and installing any additional software.

You've successfully installed VirtualBox and Ubuntu on your virtual machine.
